National Australia Bank (NAB) is migrating hundreds of sensitive, regulated financial workloads to the cloud. This session focuses on the automated approach that NAB has taken to evolve and scale its ability to meet its strict risk and regulatory requirements. Specifically, NAB describes its cloud governance framework and the automated enforcement platform (Deputy) that supports it and that brings governance and technology together to ensure that compliant workloads are deployed in the cloud. The talk dives deep into the architecture of Deputy, which uses AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon RDS to create a cost-efficient, scalable solution.

<h3><u>Bankâ€™s Background</h3></u>

* 160 years old
* Based in Melbourne

* 33k employees
* 900 locations
* Largest business bank


<h3><u>Our Challange</h3></u>

* Highly regulated industry
* Governance is critical and non-negotiable (2013 for cloud workload)
* Migration Hundreds of workloads to meet obligations


<h3><u>Moving to the cloud fast and safe - Making Governance easier</h3></u>

* Several thousands of workloads to migrate (700 in first wave)

<h3><u>Different approaches to pipelines they could of took</h3></u>

* Fully flexiable
    * Audits, security reviews

* Fully closed
    * Mostly automated
    * Centrally managed
    * Centrally controlled

* Middle ground (What they have chosen)
    * Mostly automated
    * Centrally captured
    * Centrally enforced

<h3><u>Continuous governance @ NAB</h3></u>

* Governance framework (CAST*) what good looks like
* Our technology platform - Accesses and enforces compliance
* Built by NAB on AWS
* Together with AWS professional services team
* Codify and automatically enforce organisational and industry best practices to continuously quantify and manage risk
* Compliance report on every single build via their CI pipelines

<h3><u>Business outcomes</h3></u>

* Stronger security posture
* More consistent production deployments
* Advanced telemetry about what is going on per deployment/workload
* More confidence

<h3><u>Today @ NAB:</h3></u>

* 35 teams in production - 20% of their CI/CD workload

<h3><u>Framework perspectives/points</h3></u>

* Supplier
* Architecture
* Devops and delivery
